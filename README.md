# Random guesser

Simple DQN program to try and solve different pseduo random methods

Most of the code is generated using ai

## The game
Within `rngs.py` are several different function that return random numbers of varying difficulty to predicts

<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>

The agent is trying to solve these games, for now I have simply implemented DQN.

the agents will not run without adding the path to find the game
