DQN solves not_random_repeating
Doesn't solve not_random_adition even with lstm and improved replay memory
With fine tuning it is ok for addition
Very good for multiplication
Very goof for Power
DQN fails to show any progess on lcg after 500 episodes

Transformer with exponetntial doesn't solve not_random_adition
Transformer does not work with linear, trying fine tuning
Transformer seems useless

PPO does nto work for lcg atleast

CEM (Cross-Entropy Method.) - doesnt seem to work reliable most likely due to format of code
